# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
The AirBnB Clone project is a step-by-step initiative to build a simplified version of the AirBnB web application. The goal is to learn and practice **full-stack development concepts** including backend, frontend, database management, and deployment.

## Project Goals
- Understand and implement object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
- Build a command-line interface for data management.
- Develop a RESTful API for handling application data.
- Design and integrate a database for persistence.
- Create a dynamic front-end interface for users.
- Deploy the application to a production environment.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** Flask (backend), possibly React or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (frontend)  
- **Database:** MySQL / SQLite  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Deployment:** Docker / Heroku / AWS (depending on stage)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Otavie/airbnb-clone-project.git
   cd airbnb-clone-project

## Team Roles

In order to build the AirBnB Clone project efficiently, the team is divided into specialized roles. Each role ensures smooth progress, quality delivery, and collaboration.

### 1. Project Manager (PM)
- Oversees the project timeline, deliverables, and team coordination.
- Ensures that goals, deadlines, and milestones are met.
- Acts as the main communicator between the team and stakeholders.

### 2. Backend Developer
- Responsible for implementing the application logic and APIs using Python (Flask/Django).
- Manages data processing, authentication, and communication between the front end and the database.
- Ensures that the system is scalable and secure.

### 3. Frontend Developer
- Builds the user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and optionally React).
- Ensures that the design is responsive, interactive, and user-friendly.
- Integrates front-end components with backend services.

### 4. Database Administrator (DBA)
- Designs and manages the project database (MySQL/SQLite).
- Ensures data consistency, security, and optimization.
- Works closely with backend developers to implement database queries and migrations.

### 5. DevOps Engineer
- Handles deployment, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Manages server infrastructure, Docker, and cloud hosting (e.g., AWS/Heroku).
- Ensures reliability, performance monitoring, and scalability.

### 6. QA Engineer (Tester)
- Creates test cases and performs manual/automated testing.
- Ensures the application is free from bugs and meets requirements.
- Works with developers to fix and re-test issues.

### 7. UI/UX Designer
- Designs wireframes, prototypes, and user flows.
- Focuses on accessibility, ease of navigation, and visual appeal.
- Collaborates with frontend developers to bring designs to life.

## Technology Stack

The AirBnB Clone project uses a modern technology stack that supports **scalability**, **maintainability**, and **ease of collaboration**. Each technology serves a specific purpose in the system architecture.

### 1. Python
- The primary programming language for implementing backend logic.
- Provides flexibility, readability, and a rich ecosystem of libraries.

### 2. Django / Flask
- **Django**: A high-level web framework that enables rapid development and clean design patterns (used for building RESTful APIs, authentication, and admin dashboards).
- **Flask**: A lightweight alternative used for microservices and modular development when more flexibility is needed.

### 3. PostgreSQL / MySQL
- Relational database systems for storing persistent data such as users, bookings, property listings, and transactions.
- Ensures data integrity, indexing, and optimized queries.

### 4. GraphQL (optional extension)
- Provides a flexible query language for APIs.
- Allows frontend clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.

### 5. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the frontend.
- **CSS**: Styles and formats the interface for a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, client-side validation, and dynamic rendering.

### 6. React (optional enhancement)
- A frontend JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces.
- Improves responsiveness and enhances the user experience.

### 7. Git & GitHub
- **Git**: Version control system to track code changes and enable collaboration.
- **GitHub**: A remote repository for hosting code, managing issues, and collaborating with teammates.

### 8. Docker
- Containerization platform to package and deploy applications consistently across environments.
- Ensures portability and eliminates "works on my machine" issues.

### 9. Heroku / AWS (Deployment)
- **Heroku**: A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for simple deployment and scaling.
- **AWS**: Provides cloud infrastructure for high scalability, load balancing, and production readiness.
