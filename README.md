# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
The AirBnB Clone project is a step-by-step initiative to build a simplified version of the AirBnB web application. The goal is to learn and practice **full-stack development concepts** including backend, frontend, database management, and deployment.

## Project Goals
- Understand and implement object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
- Build a command-line interface for data management.
- Develop a RESTful API for handling application data.
- Design and integrate a database for persistence.
- Create a dynamic front-end interface for users.
- Deploy the application to a production environment.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** Flask (backend), possibly React or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (frontend)  
- **Database:** MySQL / SQLite  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Deployment:** Docker / Heroku / AWS (depending on stage)

## Team Roles

In order to build the AirBnB Clone project efficiently, the team is divided into specialized roles. Each role ensures smooth progress, quality delivery, and collaboration.

### 1. Project Manager (PM)
- Oversees the project timeline, deliverables, and team coordination.
- Ensures that goals, deadlines, and milestones are met.
- Acts as the main communicator between the team and stakeholders.

### 2. Backend Developer
- Responsible for implementing the application logic and APIs using Python (Flask/Django).
- Manages data processing, authentication, and communication between the front end and the database.
- Ensures that the system is scalable and secure.

### 3. Frontend Developer
- Builds the user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and optionally React).
- Ensures that the design is responsive, interactive, and user-friendly.
- Integrates front-end components with backend services.

### 4. Database Administrator (DBA)
- Designs and manages the project database (MySQL/SQLite).
- Ensures data consistency, security, and optimization.
- Works closely with backend developers to implement database queries and migrations.

### 5. DevOps Engineer
- Handles deployment, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Manages server infrastructure, Docker, and cloud hosting (e.g., AWS/Heroku).
- Ensures reliability, performance monitoring, and scalability.

### 6. QA Engineer (Tester)
- Creates test cases and performs manual/automated testing.
- Ensures the application is free from bugs and meets requirements.
- Works with developers to fix and re-test issues.

### 7. UI/UX Designer
- Designs wireframes, prototypes, and user flows.
- Focuses on accessibility, ease of navigation, and visual appeal.
- Collaborates with frontend developers to bring designs to life.
