# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
The AirBnB Clone project is a step-by-step initiative to build a simplified version of the AirBnB web application. The goal is to learn and practice **full-stack development concepts** including backend, frontend, database management, and deployment.

## Project Goals

- Build a command-line interface for data management.
- Develop a RESTful API for handling application data.
- Design and integrate a database for persistence.
- Create a dynamic front-end interface for users.
- Deploy the application to a production environment.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** Flask (backend), possibly React or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (frontend)  
- **Database:** MySQL / SQLite  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Deployment:** Docker / Heroku / AWS (depending on stage)
